This is a program that perform the well know k-nn and w-nn machine learning algorithms in order to predict a classification data and numerical regression one, represented, respectfully, by the files ionosphere.arff and autos.arff.

Some variants of the cited algorithms have been implemented, like Value Difference Measure and Ln-norm.

USAGE:
    Simple Syntax:
        
    


EXAMPLE:
    c k 5: Pick classification data and use the k-nn algorithm
